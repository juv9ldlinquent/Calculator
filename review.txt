1. it is  best to use switch cases when buildingapps like calculators or menu-driven programs where multiple discrete options are available. Switch cases enhance code readability and maintainability by clearly delineating each case, making it easier to understand the flow of the program. They also help in reducing the complexity that can arise from using multiple if-else statements, especially when dealing with numerous conditions. Additionally, switch cases can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, as they can be optimized by the compiler for faster execution compared to a series of if-else checks.

2. when I add numbers, it stills for a valid input, this is happening because you are tryng to catch ValueError at the end of the program regardless there was a succesful operation ornot , which is a bit confusing, work on your error handling and make sure you only catch an error or invalid inputs when you are supposed  (i have sent the image of the above issue in your dm )

3. try to add a bit of comments to your code, this will help you and others understand the code better when you revisit it in the future. the intnetion is to makethecode more readable and easier to maintain, the comment also eplains why you wrote a particular liine of code 

4. when you are asking for user input, it is a good practice to provide clear instructions on what kind of input is expected. this helps in reducing errors and ensures that the user knows exactly what to enter. for example, instead of just asking for "Type in an operation", you could specify "Type in an operation (+, -, *, /) followed by two numbers separated by spaces". this way, the user has a better understanding of how to interact with your program. Do not assume users are smart enough to know how to go about programm , most often they are not and will need clear guidance else they wiill break your program

5. consider adding input validation to ensure that the user inputs are within the expected range or format. for example, if your calculator only supports basic arithmetic operations, you should validate that the operation entered is one of the supported ones (+, -, *, /). similarly, you should check that the numbers entered are valid integers or floats. this will help in preventing runtime errors and improve the overall user experience by providing meaningful feedback when invalid inputs are detected.

6. consider handling exceptions more specifically. Instead of catching a general ValueError at the end, try to catch exceptions closer to where they might occur. This makes your error handling more precise and your code easier to debug.

7. lastly, consider implementing a loop that allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program each time. this can enhance user experience by providing a seamless way to continue using the calculator until they choose to exit. you can achieve this by wrapping the main functionality of your calculator in a while loop that continues to prompt the user for input until they decide to quit, for example, by entering a specific command like 'exit' or 'quit'.
